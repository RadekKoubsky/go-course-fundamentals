/*
In Go servers, each incoming request is handled in its own goroutine.
Request handlers often start additional goroutines to access backends such as databases and RPC services.
The set of goroutines working on a request typically needs access to request-specific values such as
the identity of the end user, authorization tokens, and the requestâ€™s deadline. When a request is
canceled or times out, all the goroutines working on that request should exit quickly so the system
can reclaim any resources they are using.

At Google, we developed a context package that makes it easy to pass request-scoped values,
cancellation signals, and deadlines across API boundaries to all the goroutines involved in handling a request.
The package is publicly available as context

Context allows running and managing multiple goroutines within a specific process.
It provides execution, cancellation, shutdown and other operations for a set of goroutines in order to
prevent goroutine leaks.

Context is similar to Executor framework in java to manage tasks and threads.
