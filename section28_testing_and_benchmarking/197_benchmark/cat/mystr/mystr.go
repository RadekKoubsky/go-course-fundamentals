		The implementation of concatenation often involves off-by-one error.
		An off-by-one error or off-by-one bug (known by acronyms OBOE, OBO, OB1 and OBOB) is a logic error involving the discrete equivalent of a boundary condition.

		More specifically, it contains the special case of this error caled Fencepost error:
		A fencepost error is a specific type of off-by-one error.

		In this scenario, a fence with n sections will have n + 1 posts. Conversely, if the fence contains n posts, it will contain n âˆ’ 1 sections.
		In our impl:
		"section" -> space separator
		"posts" -> words

		Number of spaces = len(posts) - 1
